				<p>The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform
					more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm
					overloaded
					with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e.,
					the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error
					conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in
					this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer
					hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful
					moon landing it was.[26]
